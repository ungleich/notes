# Zero carbon infrastructure

This list is a collection of providers (VPS, hosting, email, etc.) that run their business on renewable energy and have a commitment towards the environment.

This list focuses on **zero carbon** providers, not on carbon neutral ones.

## VPS and hosting

### datacenterlight.ch

[datacenterlight.ch](https://datacenterlight.ch/) is located in Swissland. They operate with 99.9% hydropower from the Alps and a 0.01% from solar energy. They claim also to reuse existing factory halls instead of building everything new. They have been mentioned by [Julian Oliver](http://twitter.com/julian0liver) in his talk [Server Infrastructure for Global Rebellion](https://media.ccc.de/v/36c3-11008-server_infrastructure_for_global_rebellion).

From their [renewable energy page](https://datacenterlight.ch/en-us/cms/hydropower/):

> Not every data center has an in-house hydropower plant, but we do. Data Center Light runs with 99.9%\* hydropower. Few meters away from where our servers are running, the hydropower plant is generating electricity in the basement. We assure you that our electricity is made of 100% renewable energy.
>
> \*0.1 % of electricity comes from solar power.

We have been front runners in this field for over fifteen years, and we still strive towards maximal sustainability in every step of our production process. This goes just as much for the small choices, like which coffee or furniture to use and for the big contributions, like which hardware or energy supplier to select. This page provides more background information on policy and the choices made.

### greengeeks.com
