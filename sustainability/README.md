## E-mail

### mailbox.org

[mailbox.org](https://mailbox.org/en/) is a company based Berlin, Germany, that runs on 100% green energy. They claim that their servers are energy-efficient and powered by eco-friendly energy. They use renewable energy in their offices, too, provided by the company "Lichtblick". On top of that "whenever we need to go visit one of the data centers we use public transport or car-sharing offers by Stadtmobil. Should a flight be necessary, we compensate the extra emissions caused with a contribution to Atmosfair."

I'm a mailbox user and I'm quite satisfied.

### posteo.de

[posteo.de](https://posteo.de/en) is an independent email service based in Berlin, Germany. They are highly concerned with sustainability, security, privacy and usability.

From their [sustainability page](https://posteo.de/en/site/sustainability):

Our servers and offices run 100% on green energy from Greenpeace Energy, which comes from hydro stations and wind turbines in Austria and Germany. Greenpeace Energy makes no compromises in terms of its supply concept and development of new facilities:

- No greenwashing: Greenpeace Energy does not label power from coal or nuclear sources as green energy and declines to deal in certificate trading such as RECS.
- Transparency: Greenpeace Energy openly displays its supply sources for its customers to see.
- Promoting new facilities: Within five years at the latest, new customers are supplied with 100% power from facilities that are less than five years old.
